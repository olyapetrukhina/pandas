# Pandas Puzzles Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the [Pandas Puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles) created by ajcr to help users practice and improve their skills in using the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

These puzzles focuse on different aspects of data manipulation, such as:

* DataFrame creation
* Indexing and selecting data
* Grouping and aggregation
* Merging and concatenation
* Time series manipulation
